        In my free time I enjoy riding my bicycle up and down the Katy Trail which stretches across the state of Missouri. I also enjoy fishing on the numerous fresh water lakes and rivers located in Missouri. My favorite type of fishing would be bass fishing with white bass a close second. Yes, I whole heartedly support Linux and a free and open source community. When I am not outside enjoying the weather I am playing RPG & FPS computer games, such as DOOM, The Witcher, and Castle Wolfenstein. I also have been known to read a few good science fiction novels, as well, in no particular order, Starship Troopers, Extinction Cycle, Children of Time, and many others. Welcome and please enjoy your stay!
